Excited to see you at the upcoming OutSystems JumpStart Workshops! If this is your first time, congratulations on taking the first step. If you're returning for this workshop, glad to see you again!

This page describes all the steps required to get started, including some optional requirements for more advanced workshops. To make it easier for you, we've organized the content by requirement type, which you can navigate using the sidebar.

We'd appreciate it if you could prepare everything listed below before the event so we can make the most of our time together.

## Workshop Requirement 2: Deep Dive Workshops (Best Practices)

In some workshops, we dive deep into best practices for building applications and AI agents, including architecture. For those sessions, you'll need the **OutSystems Docs MCP** (unofficial), which enables your AI tools to interact with the OutSystems documentation.

You will need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.13 preferred)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — Python package and project manager

Install the OutSystems Docs MCP (unofficial):

### Step 1: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donnieprakoso/mcp-outsystems-docs.git
```

### Step 2: Install All the Requirements

```bash
uv sync
```

### Step 3: Build the Semantic Index of the OutSystems Documentation (O11 and ODC)

```bash
uv run sync
```

### Step 4: Install the MCP into Your Agent

```bash
claude mcp add outsystems-docs -- uv run --directory /path/to/mcp-outsystems-docs osmcp-serve
```

### Step 5: Try and Test It Out

Send this prompt to your agent:

```text
With OutSystems Docs MCP, what are the best practices for building apps with ODC?
```

## Workshop Requirement 3: Agentic Experience Workshop

If your workshop covers Agentic Experience, you'll need the following tools:

- AI coding agent with MCP support, for example Claude Code, Codex, Kiro, OpenCode, or Pi
- Access to the Agent Experience Early Access Program (EAP)
- Access to your OutSystems tenant

The following example steps use OpenCode, but any MCP-capable agent works the same way.

### Step 1: Get Your OutSystems Tenant URL

Sign in to the [ODC Portal](https://go.outsystems.com). Your tenant URL follows this pattern:

```text
https://<your-tenant>.outsystems.dev
```

### Step 2: Add the OutSystems MCP Configuration

In OpenCode, add the OutSystems MCP server to your `opencode.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "outsystems": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://<your-tenant>.outsystems.dev/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<your-tenant>` with your tenant name from Step 1 — the MCP endpoint is your tenant URL followed by `/mcp`.

For Claude Code, add the same endpoint using:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http outsystems https://<your-tenant>.outsystems.dev/mcp
```

### Step 3: Authenticate Your OutSystems MCP

The OutSystems MCP is protected by standard OAuth — there are no tokens or API keys to manage manually. Make your first OutSystems request in your agent, and it will prompt you to sign in through your browser. Complete the sign-in, and you're connected.

### Step 4: Test It

Send this prompt to your agent:

```text
List all of my assets in my OutSystems tenancy
```

Your agent should respond with a list of assets from your OutSystems tenant.
